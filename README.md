This was a simple website made using HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap.

In order for the website to work from downloading the files, you need to:

Change all "C:\Users\delroy\Desktop\ACM_stuff\MY_ACM\..." to "C:\Users\PUT YOUR USER FOLDER HERE\Desktop\usf_acm_website-master\about.html" 
and so forth 

For images change them to "C:\Users\PUT YOUR USER FOLDER HERE\Desktop\usf_acm_website-master\images\acm_logo.png" and so forth
